I've made a few maps before, with some more than overwhelming help from KingTomato, but this is my first official map.  Mitigation is usually used as a legal term, but a quick definition of it is - To make the surrounding world seem less harsh.  Mainly I want to thank KingTomato, Lokie, and the rest of the GoDz crew who helped me out on this map. Yes, even indo's dad gave a few suggestions. Thanks pop! Special thanks one more time to Lokie!  Without you, there probably wouldn't be any working teleports.";
