The battle is taking place amongst the grounds which appear to be the training fields of their top forces.  Neither tribe has a permanent base, instead each team must keep moving, and change their directions of play to keep the enemy unaware of their playing style. Warp to the enemy's flag and bring it to your warp to your flag, touching it to your own flag to capture it.  Victory will be achieved by the team that successfully captures their opponent's flag " @ $teamScoreLimit @ " times." @
