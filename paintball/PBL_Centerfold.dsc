Now the <vServer::teamName1> and <vServer::teamName0> battle over thier flags in an arena placed there years before them.  Two flags are located in the arena, one underneath each of the two bases.  The flag must be brought back to your base to score. First to 10 caps wins! The PBL would like to thank all of those which made this possible. Send any Paintball maps or ideas to Nitros.
