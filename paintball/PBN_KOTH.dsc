Yes, it's tribes style of course, but its was made Nitros' style!  Not that much like the real King of the Hill, but it's fun nevertheless.  Anti base tk, anti spawn kill, sorta anti spawn camp, its good though, have fun!  Official PBN Maps! PS. GET THAT OBJECTIVE OR YOU LOSE! And send maps or ideas to Nitros!  AIM=Nitros CS";
